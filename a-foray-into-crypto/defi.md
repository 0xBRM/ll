# DeFi

DeFi, short for Decentralized Finance, refers to the emerging ecosystem of financial applications built atop of decentralized blockchain networks. These applications operate in a decentralized manner, without the need for intermediaries such as banks or financial institutions.

DeFi leverages the benefits of blockchain technology—especially efficiency and security—to provide expanded access to wealth creation to traditionally under/unserved people while protecting them from censorship by central banks or governments and significantly reducing fees paid to intermediaries.

## The benefits of DeFi include:

* **Accessibility:** DeFi applications are open to anyone with an internet connection, regardless of their location or financial status. This enables greater financial inclusion and access to financial services.
* **Transparency:** DeFi applications operate on a public blockchain network, providing transparency and visibility into the system's operations. This helps to prevent fraudulent activities and promotes trust in the system.
* **Security:** DeFi applications use cryptographic algorithms and smart contracts to secure transactions, making them resistant to hacking and fraud.
* **Lower costs:** DeFi applications eliminate the need for intermediaries such as banks or financial institutions, reducing transaction costs and making financial services more affordable.
* **Innovation:** DeFi is a fast-growing sector with a lot of innovation and experimentation. Developers are constantly creating new financial applications, such as lending platforms, decentralized exchanges, and stablecoins, which offer unique benefits and opportunities for users.
