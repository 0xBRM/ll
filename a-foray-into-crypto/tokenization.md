# Tokenization

Most forms of value can be represented as digital tokens on a blockchain.

## The Tokenization ofâ€¦

* **Physical Assets:** Tokenization can represent real-world physical assets like real estate, art, or even physical commodities. Each token represents a fractional ownership in the underlying physical asset. This can potentially make these assets more liquid and accessible to a broader range of investors.
* **Intangible Assets:** Intellectual property, patents, copyrights, and even people's time or expertise can be tokenized. For example, a musician might issue tokens representing a share in the royalties from their future music. This could provide a new way for artists to fund their work and for fans to participate in the success of artists they support.
* **Financial Assets:** Stocks, bonds, derivatives, and other financial instruments can be tokenized. This could potentially increase the efficiency and transparency of financial markets.
* **Digital Assets:** Online content, domain names, virtual goods in video games, and other digital assets can be tokenized. This can enable new business models for digital content creators and other online businesses.
* **Identity and Reputation:** People's identities, online histories, credit scores, and other personal data could potentially be tokenized (in a privacy preserving manner). This could enable new ways of managing and controlling personal data, and could also enable new kinds of online reputation systems.
* **Governance Rights:** Tokens can represent voting rights in decentralized organizations or platforms. This could potentially democratize access to decision-making power in these organizations.
